# Predictive Maintenance Use Case
Predictive Maintenance for Aircraft Reliability: Brake Failure Prediction Model

This project represents an intersection of data science and aviation reliability. We are focused on building a failure prediction model for detecting failures on brakes for widebody twin-jet aircraft. This repository provides an experience for students in mathematics, econometrics, data science, and other related fields, guiding them through a simplified version of the stages of a data science project. From data preprocessing and analysis to model development, our goal is to create a reliable predictive tool while educating the next generation of data scientists in applying their skills to practical scenarios.
